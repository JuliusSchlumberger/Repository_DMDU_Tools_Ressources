This is the information that usually results from climate effect and adaptation options research projects. Added to this is functionality to interactively vary climate pressure and characteristics of measures, and instantly view what the result of these changes are on adaptive capacity, co-benefits and costs. This will help create awareness, help with chosing and planning of measures and support decision making about adaptation strategies.</td>

Robust strategies refer to management options that perform sufficiently well or acceptably under a range of potential system conditions, rather than optimally in a single, nominal state of the world. Exploratory modeling allows for the simulation of the system under an ensemble of states of the world, so as to discover the ones with consequential effects on the system. Rhodium facilitates rapid application of the RDM and MORDM frameworks by providing a suite of optimization, visualization, scenario discovery, and sensitivity analysis functions. Rhodium is written in Python and can interface with models written in Python, C and C++, Fortran, R, and Excel.</td>

However, there are many robustness metrics and many ways of generating scenarios, making it difficult to know which to choose in order to quantify system robustness and to make robust decisions. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a generic guidance framework to assist with the identification of the most robust decision alternatives, as well as the RAPID (Robustness Analysis Producing Intelligent Decisions) software package which is a consistent and easy-to-use implementation of the framework.</td>
