(2021);This briefing introduces adaptation pathways for infrastructure resilience under uncertain future climate conditions. It includes a framework with nine steps for developing pathways (e.g., defining scope, identifying hazards, generating options, and evaluating pathways). Case studies from the Thames Estuary, Dutch Delta Programme, and others illustrate the method, alongside stakeholder feedback and benefits. The approach combines Quinn et al.'s (2018) Rail Adapt framework with practical applications for UK infrastructure planning.
