Rhodium	I want to submit a tool	Rhodium	https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium	Python	B: some knowledge required	extensive coverage	extensive coverage	extensive coverage	extensive coverage	extensive coverage		some coverage	some coverage	some coverage	some coverage	extensive coverage	extensive coverage	Rhodium is an open source Python library for robust decision making (RDM), many-objective robust decision making (MORDM), and exploratory modeling. These decision-support frameworks enable the identification of robust strategies for the management of complex environmental systems, by evaluating the tradeoffs among candidate strategies, and characterizing their vulnerabilities. Robust strategies refer to management options that perform sufficiently well or acceptably under a range of potential system conditions, rather than optimally in a single, nominal state of the world. Exploratory modeling allows for the simulation of the system under an ensemble of states of the world, so as to discover the ones with consequential effects on the system. Rhodium facilitates rapid application of the RDM and MORDM frameworks by providing a suite of optimization, visualization, scenario discovery, and sensitivity analysis functions. Rhodium is written in Python and can interface with models written in Python, C and C++, Fortran, R, and Excel.	extensive coverage

Robustness Analysis Producing Intelligent Decisions (RAPID)	I want to submit a tool	Robustness Analysis Producing Intelligent Decisions (RAPID)	https://github.com/cameronmcphail/RAPID	Python	B: some knowledge required							extensive coverage	extensive coverage	extensive coverage	extensive coverage			To aid decision making about environmental systems under deep uncertainty, robustness metrics are commonly used to represent system performance over a number of scenarios. However, there are many robustness metrics and many ways of generating scenarios, making it difficult to know which to choose in order to quantify system robustness and to make robust decisions. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a generic guidance framework to assist with the identification of the most robust decision alternatives, as well as the RAPID (Robustness Analysis Producing Intelligent Decisions) software package which is a consistent and easy-to-use implementation of the framework.

Adaptation Catalyst	I want to submit a tool	Adaptation Catalyst	https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/spaces/AP/pages/142674737/Adaptation+Catalyst	Web app	A: suited for beginners				extensive coverage	extensive coverage								The Adaptation Catalyst is a software tool designed to help overcome the ‘implementation gap’ in realizing adaptive capacity, to get from research and design to actual realization of measures. The AC does this by offering the possiblity to assemble primary information about climate pressure and the adaptive capacity of measures into one overview. This is the information that usually results from climate effect and adaptation options research projects. Added to this is functionality to interactively vary climate pressure and characteristics of measures, and instantly view what the result of these changes are on adaptive capacity, co-benefits and costs. This will help create awareness, help with chosing and planning of measures and support decision making about adaptation strategies.
